# Colourful
This repo was initially created only for in-app theming tests. Later, I decided to take a look into different state managers, navigations, etc based on this project with the Expo framework.
There are different branches and PRs. Every PR is created after tests with selected technology.

## Stack
- redux
- redux-toolkit
- react-navigation

## Supported functions
- Toggle light/dark theme
- Change theme colors
- Toggle English/Ukrainian languages
- Set or change the background image
- Set or change icons for theme/language switchers
- Toggle Roboto/Oswald font family

All changes are stored in AsyncStorage and available after restarting the application. If the cache is cleared or images cannot be loaded, you will see the selected background color for the selected theme or standard image for the icons.
